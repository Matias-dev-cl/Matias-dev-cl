# Matías Muñoz

Computer Science student interested in software development, with a strong focus on problem solving and building practical systems. I am currently strengthening my fundamentals by working on real projects and learning modern development tools.

## About

I am studying Computer Science (Engineering in Informatics) and I am exploring software development in a broad sense, without limiting myself to a single role or stack. I enjoy programming logic such as validations, rules, and core functionality, and I am especially motivated by solving real-world problems rather than isolated exercises.

Alongside development, I am actively learning tools and workflows used in real environments, including version control and deployment basics. My current goal is to consolidate strong fundamentals and progressively improve the quality and realism of my projects.

## Technologies

Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Git, GitHub

## Projects

* **Learning Git** – Repository focused on practicing Git and GitHub workflows, including commits, branches, and merges.
* **Rural Water Management System** (in progress) – Remastering my thesis project: a management system for rural drinking water services, integrated with an automatic water meter.

## Certifications

* **AWS Academy Graduate – Cloud Foundations** (Training Badge) – Issued by Amazon Web Services Training and Certification
